                    During the experiment, eyewitnesses managed to capture anomalies that were not related to official additions to the game. They are called nothing less than "Bearers of Darkness".

            </div>

            <p>No one knows where it came from. The Abyss looks like a large, long creature. According to information from the site minecraft******.com, everyone who encounters it begins to see hallucinations. A person who encounters it no longer dreams of anything except eternal, recurring nightmares. One night, a person will no longer be able to wake up, and this means only one thing - his soul was dragged away by the Abyss.</p>
            <p>Many experiments were conducted in the old days, somewhere 100-200, maybe 300 years ago, but everything still remains unclear. Most likely, the Abyss cannot be summoned. It comes itself. And takes players to itself. Do not try to look for it.</p>

            <div>
                <img src="img/intermediary_self.png" alt="">
            </div>

            <p>The intermediary is a conduit between the world of the dead and the world of the living. During some experiments it was found that he is the imagination of the players. He does not exist. He does not exist....</p>

            <p>Number Zero came from another world. According to the website ************.org, every person he saw will disappear soon.
